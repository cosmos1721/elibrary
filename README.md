Project Description: As the name suggests, This is an E-Library Webpage.
                     Due to lack of time, many features were not being able to implemented as per I thought.
                     So the current ongoing webpage include basic info about E-Library. 
                     
Project Description: Genrealised Website with some addtional designs using CSS and Js.                     
                     
Scope: I wanted to add many things but, as I said due to lack of time and skills, I couldn't.
            Ideas I wanted to implement
            1.  Login Authorization
            2.  Access books and rsources to those who login using @gbu.ac.in
            3.  Work on better representation of resources. (i haven't added it yet)
            4.  More animations and transitions.
            5.  Monitering resources that a user is read/ reading.
            6. There are still many points to add.
           
Challenges Faced: Since this was my very first projecton Web Development, I tried my best to come up with good ideas and designs.
                  Still I wanted to add to it more. Which i'll soon.
                  Lack of knowledge about technologies.
                  
Conclusion: I would actually like to thank the whole team of Techno Club as they started this hackathon. 
            This gave me motivation to work on my skills.                   
            Despite not being able to cover all my ideas, I'm still happy to be a part of it.
